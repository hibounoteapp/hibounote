## 🦉Introduction
<p align="justify"> 
Completely free and without any limitations, Hibounote is a Open Source project that offers a visual and infinite canvas where you can create and manage as many boards as your creativity demands. Whether you're brainstorming, planning projects, or jotting down notes, Hibounote provides an unrestricted, seamless environment to help you turn your thoughts into structured plans.  
</p>

Built in `Angular` with [jsplumb](https://jsplumbtoolkit.com/community) and [Panzoom](https://github.com/timmywil/panzoom/tree/main) Hibounote is a free and open-source alternative to note organization apps like:
- Milanote;
- Evernote;
- Notion;
- Miro.

The idea it's to be a completely free web app, since all these options offer a freemium aproach.
